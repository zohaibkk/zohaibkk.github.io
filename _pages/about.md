Welcome to my professional space!

I am Zohaib Ahmad, a dedicated Research Associate at the National Center for Robotics and Automation (NCRA), where I specialize in developing advanced condition monitoring systems. My journey into research and technology has been shaped by a strong foundation in engineering, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, coupled with a passion for innovation and problem-solving.

I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology and a Bachelor's in Electronic Engineering, both from Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, Pakistan. My academic projects reflect my deep interest in IoT systems and advanced image processing, including my Master's thesis on deep feature learning for remote sensing image classification.

My technical expertise spans programming languages such as Python, C++, and Embedded C, with a strong command of frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV. Iâ€™ve successfully applied these skills across various roles, including data annotation, teaching, and as a mentor in AI and data science.

Beyond my professional work, I am an active member of the QS Impact community, contributing to initiatives aligned with SDG goals, and have been honored with multiple QS World Merit Awards for my impactful work in education and health.

With a track record of research publications and technical certifications from industry leaders like Huawei, Google, and Cisco, I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and deliver meaningful contributions to the fields of AI, machine learning, and automation.
